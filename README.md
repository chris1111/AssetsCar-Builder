## Utility to create Assets.car from a PNG icon file in macOS
#### This is a very useful application, given that in macOS Tahoe 26, AppleScript applications now contain Assets.car files. If you have a display dialog with icon note this will allow you to have your personal icon displayed.

#### So you'll have the Assets.car file created and also an applet.icns file.
So, change both files in the Resources of your new application, Zip the App then Unzip and Voila.
#### Assets.car file can be use on any other App with the file AppIcon.icns create.

- Working from 10.8 to macOS Tahoe 26
- You need Xcode and the commandLine xcrun. Type: `xcrun  --show-sdk-version` to verify
- You need an Icon (.png) 512x512px
